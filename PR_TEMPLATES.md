## PR Template for Issue #1: 3-Second Countdown

### Title
Add 3-second countdown before practice starts (Issue #1)

### Description
Implements the requested 3-second countdown feature that displays "3, 2, 1, GO!" before the practice timer begins.

### Changes Made
- ✅ Added countdown state management (`isCountingDown`, `countdownValue`, `countdownInterval`)
- ✅ Modified `startPractice()` to show countdown sequence before actual practice
- ✅ Created `startActualPractice()` method for post-countdown initialization
- ✅ Updated `stopPractice()` to handle countdown cancellation
- ✅ Added countdown-specific CSS animations with pulsing effect
- ✅ Integrated audio feedback (600Hz for countdown, 1000Hz for GO!)
- ✅ Maintained full backward compatibility

### Testing
- [x] Countdown displays 3, 2, 1, GO! sequence with proper timing
- [x] Audio beeps play for each countdown step
- [x] Practice starts automatically after countdown completes
- [x] Stop button cancels countdown properly
- [x] All existing functionality remains intact
- [x] Visual animations work smoothly
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts still functional

### Screenshots/Demo
*Demo available at: http://localhost:8080 after checkout*

### Review Notes
- No external dependencies added
- Performance impact: minimal (1-second intervals)
- Browser compatibility: all modern browsers
- Accessibility: visual and audio feedback provided

## PR Template for Issue #2: Camera Movement Detection

### Title
Add camera-based body movement detection for L/R alignment (Issue #2)

### Description
Implements camera-based body movement detection to monitor if user movement aligns with the displayed L/R direction boxes, providing real-time visual feedback.

### Changes Made
- ✅ Added camera access functionality using Web APIs
- ✅ Implemented frame-by-frame motion detection algorithm
- ✅ Created left/right movement classification system
- ✅ Added visual feedback system (green for correct, red for incorrect alignment)
- ✅ Integrated motion detection with practice flow
- ✅ Added graceful camera permission handling
- ✅ Created camera status UI with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Ensured app works perfectly without camera access

### Technical Implementation
- **Motion Detection:** Pixel difference analysis between frames
- **Direction Classification:** Motion analysis in left/right frame halves
- **Performance:** Optimized with requestAnimationFrame and pixel sampling
- **Privacy:** No camera data stored or transmitted
- **Fallback:** Complete functionality without camera

### Testing
- [x] Camera permission requested appropriately
- [x] Motion detection activates during practice sessions
- [x] Left movement correctly detected and classified
- [x] Right movement correctly detected and classified
- [x] Visual feedback shows green borders for correct alignment
- [x] Visual feedback shows red borders for incorrect alignment
- [x] App functions normally when camera access denied
- [x] Camera status updates reflect current state
- [x] No performance impact on practice timing

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome (desktop/mobile)
- ✅ Firefox (desktop/mobile)
- ✅ Safari (desktop/mobile) - requires HTTPS
- ✅ Edge (desktop)

### Security & Privacy
- Camera stream processed locally only
- No data transmission or storage
- Permissions handled according to web standards
- Graceful degradation when denied

### Screenshots/Demo
*Demo available at: http://localhost:8080 after checkout*
*Note: Requires HTTPS for camera access in production*

### Review Notes
- **HTTPS Required:** Camera API requires secure connection in production
- **Performance:** Motion detection optimized for smooth gameplay
- **Privacy:** All processing happens client-side
- **Accessibility:** Visual feedback clearly distinguishable
- **Fallback:** App fully functional without camera

### Deployment Checklist for Reviewer
- [ ] Verify HTTPS setup for production deployment
- [ ] Test camera permissions in target browsers
- [ ] Validate graceful fallback behavior
- [ ] Monitor performance impact during extended use
- [ ] Consider privacy policy updates if needed
